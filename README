** Prerequisites

*** dlvhex
For instructions how to install dlvhex, see the respective README there.

plugin locally in your home, use the configure-switch --enable-userinstall

the configuration of dlvhex (usually /usr/local/lib/dlvhex/plugins or similar).

Run "make install" to install the plugin. It will be placed at a location
determined by configure.
